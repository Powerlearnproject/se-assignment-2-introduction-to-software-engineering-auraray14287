# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
Software engineering is the branch of computer science that deals with the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software applications.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software engineering involves a more structured and organized software development process that includes requirements engineering, design, coding, testing, and maintenance. In contrast, software development may be a less structured process that involves writing code, testing, and deploying the software.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
1. Planning & Requirement Analysis
Identify security requirements.
Select security measures to counter threats and vulnerabilities.
2. Architectural Design
Apply security design principles.
Conduct threat modeling, access control, encryption, and risk analysis.
3. Software Development & Testing
Perform code reviews for standard compliance.
Run security tests like penetration testing.
4. Deployment
Use automated DevSecOps tools.
Configure firewalls, access controls, and security settings.
5. Maintenance
Continuously monitor for vulnerabilities.
Update software with security patches.

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Agile is an iterative and incremental approach, where requirements and solutions evolve through the collaborative effort of self-organizing and cross-functional teams. Waterfall is a linear, sequential approach, where each phase of the project must be completed before moving on to the next phase.

Requirements Engineering:
What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Requirements engineering is the process of defining, documenting, and maintaining requirements. It involves activities like elicitation, analysis, specification, and verification to ensure software meets stakeholders' needs. Proper management improves project clarity, reduces errors, and aligns expectations.

Software Design Principles:
Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Modularity in software design is a technique where complex software is divided into smaller, independent modules, such as functions, classes, or components. It facilitates easier management and understanding of complex systems by breaking them down into digestible parts.

Testing in Software Engineering:
Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Unit Testing
Unit testing is the first level of testing. This testing is the most basic type of testing done by the developers before handing the software/product to the testing team.

Integration Testing
Integration testing is the second level of testing. The testers, rather than the developers, mainly conduct this testing. This testing can be performed manually or using integration testing tools, such as Selenium.

System Testing
System testing is the third level of testing. This level of testing assists you in identifying bugs and challenges while ensuring that the software will meet all specific requirements. A specialized testing team is usually in charge of this type of testing.

Acceptance Testing
Acceptance testing is the last and final level of testing. This level of testing is broad in scope, ranging from simply finding spelling and cosmetic errors to discovering bugs that might produce a significant error in the software.
these testing levels add value to the software development life cycle (SDLC)

Version Control Systems:
What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Version control software keeps track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database. If a mistake is made, developers can turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake while minimizing disruption to all team members. examples include, Git

Software Project Management:
Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
A software project manager is the most important person inside a team who takes the overall responsibilities to manage the software projects and plays an important role in the successful completion of the projects.
Roles:
A software project manager is the most important person inside a team who takes the overall responsibilities to manage the software projects and plays an important role in the successful completion of the projects.

Software Maintenance:
Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Software maintenance is an integral part of the software life cycle that involves modifying and updating software after it has been deployed. The goal of maintenance is to correct faults, improve performance or other attributes, and adapt the software to a changing environment throughout its lifetime.

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:
What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
addictive design;
corporate ownership of personal data;
algorithmic bias;
weak cyber security and personally identifiable information (PII) protection; and.
overemphasis on features.
